The project was built with what I learned in the DevQuest course in HTML5 and CSS3 classes, putting Grid and Flex skills into practice as well as responsiveness. 
Google fonts and font awesome were used in this project.



### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
